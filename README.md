# ML Model Deployment with Streamlit and API

This project demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model using a Streamlit app and an API for my ImmoWeb project.
The model is deployed using Render for the API hosting and Streamlit community cloud for the user friendly web app.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase the deployment of a machine learning model using a Streamlit app and an API. The model is trained to perform accurate price predictions for Belgian estate based on many criterias such as location, amenities, living area, etc. The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the model, while the API allows programmatic access to the model's predictions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required dependencies located in src/ folder

## Usage

To use the deployed ML model, you can either interact with the Streamlit app or make requests to the API endpoints.

### Streamlit App

1. Access the deployed Streamlit app by clicking [here](https://deployementmodel-nbkf79ekyrqrbqolksalyx.streamlit.app).

2. Follow the instructions provided in the app's interface to input the required data and obtain predictions from the model.

### API

To make requests to the API endpoints, you can use tools like cURL or Postman, or integrate the API into your own applications.
Refer to the API Documentation section for details on the available endpoints and request/response formats.

## API Documentation

The API documentation provides detailed information about the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats. You can find the API documentation by clicking [here](https://immoweb-streamlit-app.onrender.com/docs).

## Streamlit App

The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the deployed ML model. It allows users to input the required data and view the model's predictions. The app is designed to be intuitive and easy to use.

You can access the deployed Streamlit app [here](https://deployementmodel-nbkf79ekyrqrbqolksalyx.streamlit.app).

## Deployment

The ML model is deployed using the following services:

- **Render**: The API is hosted on Render, which provides a scalable and reliable platform for deploying web applications and APIs.

- **Streamlit Sharing**: The Streamlit app is deployed using Streamlit Sharing, which allows easy sharing and deployment of Streamlit apps.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that the prices and other real estate-related information provided in this project are based on data available at the time of development. The real estate market is subject to rapid change due to a variety of factors, and the accuracy of this information might not be current or relevant over time.

This project is intended to showcase my skills in developing a machine learning model that is usable by everyone. It is not focused on real-time data scraping or providing accurate market insights.
